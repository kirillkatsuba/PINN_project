# Approximation of Subsurface Flow via Physics Informed Neural Netwokrs
In the current work we introduce the novel approach to training Physics
Informed Neural Networks to approximate fluid flow in porous media. We
show experimentally that accurate Neural Network can be trained on rela-
tively small dataset. Moreover, we demonstrate that such Physics Informed
Neural Networks last longer in comparision with such methods as Polynomial
Chaos Expansion and Decision Trees when the complexity of the systems in-
creases and if trained on the same dataset. In other words Physics Informed
Neural Networks can approximate systems with high degree of nonlinearity
even when limited number of samples is available
